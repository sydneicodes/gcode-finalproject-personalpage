    <h2>Make Yoga Accessible </h2>
            <p>
                Yoga has so much to offer us physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually that all communities can benefit from. Unfortunately, many people feel discouraged from pursuing yoga because of how it is conveyed and who represents it in mainstream society. Yoga is truly a practice for all and does not have to involve you turning into a human pretzel (although increased flexibility is a benefit!). Yoga can be adaptable and is important to figure out what your needs are and create your own routine.

    <h2>What is Yoga?</h2>
            <p>
                Let's start with the basics. What is yoga? Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in ancient India. It consists of movement, meditation, and breathing techniques that promotes union between the body, the mind, and the spirit. The word "yoga" literally derives from the Sanskirt word "yuj," which means "union" or "to join".
